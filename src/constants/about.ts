  `Hello, world, I'm Sultan! I build websites and make them look good. I first fell in love with this work in 2023 during my internship, where I got to design a dashboard screen in Figma and then turn it into a real webpage using HTML and CSS. Seeing my designs come to life on the screen was so exciting – that's when I knew this was for me!`,

  `As a fresh Computer Science graduate, I’ve honed my skills further through hands-on experience, including an internship at PetroChina International Jabung Ltd as an IT Support & Developer, where I bridged technical solutions with user needs.`,
